Here you can find some of my previous work and learn a little more about me.

I'm interested in pursuing research in Asset Pricing, Deep Learning, and Causal Inference in Corporate Finance. I am currently interested in addressing the limitations of asset pricing when it comes to predicting idiosyncratic price jumps.

When I'm not working, you can find me cycling or running around Washington, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, and practicing yoga.

Feel free to reach out at aenders4292 [at] gmail.com for questions, collaborations, or paper recommendations!
