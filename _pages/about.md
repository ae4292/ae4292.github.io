For my PhD, I intend to research topics in Time Series Analysis, Forecasting, and Deep Learning Zero-Shot models within the scope of Finance.

Some PhD Dissertation ideas that have sparked my interest are a foundational time series model for asset pricing and extracting factors from financial data through text embeddings. Many foundational time series are trained on a wide variety of time series data, which may make it hard for these models to be accurate predictors of financial data. Thus, training a new financial foundational model could prove as a better alternative for forecasting returns for asset pricing models. Regarding the former research idea, aligning these embeddings with real financial factors could help to provide interpretability for these types of embeddings. While I am not particularly set on these research directions yet, I plan to follow similar research ideas in the future.

Outside of work I love cycling around Lake Washington, cooking new recipes, and yoga from time to time.
