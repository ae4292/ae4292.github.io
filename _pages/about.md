I'm interested in pursuing research in Time Series, Forecasting, and Deep Learning models.

My current research interests include Anomaly Detection, Factor Models, and Time Series Generation. You can see my proejct for my previous work. For future research I am planning on developing a financial-specific foundational time series model for asset pricing. While existing foundational models are trained on diverse time series data, they may not optimally capture the unique characteristics of financial markets. I believe that creating a specialized financial foundational model could significantly improve the accuracy of return forecasting in asset pricing models. I'm also interested in exploring the extraction of factors from financial data using text embeddings, particularly in aligning these embeddings with established financial factors to enhance their interpretability.

When I'm not working/researching, you can find me cycling around Washington, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or practicing yoga.
